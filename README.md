# Dirty Bomb Single Player Utility

I have about 215 hours into Dirty Bomb and I've found that there's no intuitive way to use 'Single Player' in a friendly way. Single player in this instance means the usage of commands to play alone (i.e. SwitchLevel OBJ_XXXX) and having fun with random loadouts or trying out those jumps you saw someone on youtube do.

As a result, I have created an application that searches the actual Dirty Bomb files on the computer to come up with a list of available Mercs, Weapons, Items (Currently Unimplemented in the below pictures), and Maps. It does not interact with the game at all and thus is safe to use while the game is running and I never plan on interlacing the two.

Here are some pictures to give an idea of the program:

Any suggestions are welcome and certainly open to feature requests.
